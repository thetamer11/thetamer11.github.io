Dangerous Fields is a project that came from Ludum Dare 41, it was entered into compo and got 150th overall and 87th in fun. After many had noted that they really liked the concept and getting good feed back I decided to continue on with it. The first picture on the Right is a screen shot from the current build where the rest are from the original build.
