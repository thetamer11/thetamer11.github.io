Property Damage is about finding out who the best house on the block is by throwing punches that hit harder then the market crash of 2008. This game originally came about from Global Game Jam 2019, after the team fell in love with the idea we continued development. 
On the team Iâ€™ve been programming, tool development, and Co-Producer.
