Project Birchtree is a personal project that I'm working on with a group called Basic Witch. It's about a barista witch throwing enchanted lattes at demons who are overtaking her town from her coffee truck. We won Best Business Plan as well as Best in Category at MassDiGI's Game Challenge. Throughout the process Iâ€™ve been working on custom tools to speed up development, analytics, and enemy architecture.
