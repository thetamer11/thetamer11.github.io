  <p>Hey I'm Gavin!</p>
<p>I'm in indie dev in the Worcester area with a passion for programming, Iâ€™ve been programming for over 6 years now and have found myself doing a lot of work on tools for games. I find tools to be incredible useful because they increase the time efficiency on certain tasks or gives people the ability to do cool stuff without all the technical know-how.</p>
