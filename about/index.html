    <p>Hey my name is Gavin Camlin, I'm 19, born September 8th 1998. I am currently in my first year at Becker College for a degree in Interactive Media with a concintration in Game Development and Game Programing. I really enjoy developing my own Indie games along with working on them with friends, I plan to do a lot of game jams and develop as many quality games I can while I'm at Becker.</p>
