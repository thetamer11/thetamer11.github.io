I"§<p>Project Birchtree is a personal project that Iâ€™m working on with a group called Basic Witch. Itâ€™s about a barista witch throwing enchanted lattes at demons who are overtaking her town from her coffee truck. We won Best Business Plan as well as Best in Category at MassDiGIâ€™s Game Challenge. Throughout the process Iâ€™ve been working on custom tools to speed up development, analytics, and enemy architecture.</p>
