<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h3>

<p>While working for MassDiGI over the summer I learned a lot. I was thankful to have other brialliant minds from Cornell and MIT on the team, they really helped push me to stick to a style guide and write more readable and reusable code.</p>

<p>We also ran into a very big problem over the summer, for awhile our game wasn’t that fun. People would play it and put it down almost instantly, it took a lot of feed back, scrapping hard work, and itteration to get to the point where we are today. We constantly sought feed back from other developers on how we can improve our model and I think that’s one of the reasons our game has turned into something so addicting and fun.</p>
